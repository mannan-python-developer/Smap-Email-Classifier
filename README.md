# Spam Email Classifier

This repository contains a machine learning model for classifying emails as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The model is trained to analyze the content of emails and make predictions based on features extracted from the text.

## Features

- **TfidfVectorizer:** The TfidfVectorizer is utilized for feature extraction, transforming the raw text data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning.

- **Logistic Regression Model:** A logistic regression model is employed for classification, trained on a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails.

## Usage

1. **Training Data:** Prepare a labeled dataset with examples of both spam and non-spam emails.

2. **Feature Extraction:** Use the TfidfVectorizer to transform the text data into a feature matrix.

3. **Model Training:** Train the logistic regression model using the transformed features and corresponding labels.

4. **Prediction:** Apply the trained model to new email data to predict whether each email is spam or not.

## Code Structure

- `train_spam_classifier.py`: Python script for training the spam email classifier model.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-email-classifier.git
    cd spam-email-classifier
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Prepare your labeled dataset and update the configuration parameters in `train_spam_classifier.py` accordingly.

4. Train the model:

    ```bash
    python train_spam_classifier.py
    ```

5. Use the trained model for predictions in your own application.
